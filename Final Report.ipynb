    "# An Analysis of Four Different Formulations of Chalk on Grip Strength\n",
    "\n",
    "Ethan Basingr and Jerry H. Yu\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Climbing Chalk is commonly used to enhance grip strength in sports like rock climbing or powerlifting. Most commercial brands of climbing chalk are made with Magnesium Carbonate (MgCO3). However, Magnesium carbonate has a wide variety of crystal structures that can affect its ability to absorb water and other fluids. My friend Ethan spent months designing a new way to crystallize MgCO3, with the goal of creating a superior chalk compared to commercial brands. This report analyzes an experiment he conducted with a third friend to analyze his chalk to other brands. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Test Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment was conducted as an unbalanced block design. Practical constraints prevented easy swapping between chalks during a single test session, so chalks were tested sequentially across different days, introducing potential confounding. While eliminating this bias is impossible, two approaches were taken to address it in the final analysis. Mixed models were used to evaluate the data, as they are well-suited for situations where we want to model the effects of variables believed to be random (such as day). Basically, since we expect that day or person can affect grip strength, and because 1) we do not care about the specific effect of each individual person or day, and 2) we expect the effect to vary each time, a mixed model is most appropriate."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data was not formatted in the way of a long table, so I used excel to clean the data. Several explanatory variables were encoded in color or order of the tables, so they needed to be made explicit. I used a series of formulas for that. Thus, I created long formats of the `Chalk_Results.xlsx` and `Randomized tests.xlsx` (`Chalk_Long.xlsm` and `Metadata.slsx`) and merged and created labels for them in python. Metatdata contains information on dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are:\n",
    "- **Code:** A number from 1-24. In Excel, the color of this column indicates the date, and its value indicates whether the test used a control or chalk, and which treatment was applied. `Code` + `bChalk` form the key for `merging metadata` with `Chalk_Long`.\n",
    "- **bChalk:** a number from 1-4 (1=FL. 2=Metolius, 3=Magdust, 4=Ethan's Chalk), not directly indicative of whether chalk was used. `Code` + `bChalk` form the key for merging metadata with `Chalk_long`.\n",
    "- **Pinch_Order:** Order in which test was conducted, for each attempt (code number), the test was performed three times sequentially. `Pinch_Order` + `bChalk` + `Code` forms the primary key. \n",
    "- **Pinch:** The weight at which the board was pinched. \n",
    "- **Pull:** The weight just before the hand slipped. **Our dependent variable**. \n",
    "- **Chalk:** The actual chalk used, 0 is added for control. \n",
    "- **Used:** A Dummy variable for is chalk is used or not. U \n",
    "- **Person:** The person conducting the test, one intermediate and one advanced climber. \n",
    "- **Day:** The day when the test was conducted. Dates were, 10/30/2024,10/31/2024,11/4/2024,11/6/2024,11/8/2024,11/10/2024, and 11/14/2024. Last two were apparently \"noticeably slippery\". \n",
    "- **Day_Order:** The order in which the tests were conducted in the day. This was randomized. \n",

    "- Our exploratory data analysis (EDA) generally shows good separation based on chalk type and person, but negligible effects from day order and pinch order.\n",
    "- However, we cannot avoid confounding between chalk type and day.\n",
    "- The data is also somewhat group unbalanced, with the control group being overrepresented. Linearity appears satisfactory, but homoscedasticity and normality do not.\n",

    "## Assumption Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will test the assumptions needed for Linear Mixed Models. Confounding by chalk type and day is inevitable and could compromise our analysis. Therefore, for this assumption testing, I will sidestep this confounding by focusing on whether chalk was used at all, rather than the specific type (using the `Used` variable instead of `Chalk`). This will result in control and treatment groups of roughly equal size and remove confounding related to chalk type. The goal of this analysis is to 1) determine the best structure for random effects and 2) test if model assumptions are violated, allowing us to correct for these violations in the actual analysis."

    "### Summary\n",
    "- Use linear mixed models to model the effect of chalk and pinch strength on pull strength, with Person and Date as random effects. Day Order and Pinch Order were not used for this model because Day Order was randomized, and Pinch Order was not very significant in the EDA. \n",
    "- Perform pairwise contrasts between types of chalk or combinations of Chalk and day. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Addressing Data Abnormalities\n",
    "- For model selection, I used bootstrapped Likelihood Ratio Tests. Basically, I compared how likely the data was with a larger model and a smaller model with one or more explanatory variables removed. Instead of assuming a specific distribution, which would require our assumptions be met, I resampled out data repeatedly and used the values of my subsamples to get a distribution. This reduced the impact of heteroscedasticity and nonnormality for model selection. \n",
    "- To address non-normality, I tried a variety of different transformations. The one that worked the best was a log transform of the independent variable (Pinch). This did not entirely correct nonnormality, but the sample size was large enough that felt that the CLT would apply.\n",
    "- To address heteroscedasticity, I used robust sandwich estimators for means comparison. \n",
    "- I tried two approaches to address confounding. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Incorporate: Fit on the model with the interaction of Date and Chalk Type. This Removes the Confounding but makes interpreting the final results very difficult. Additionally, since the number of observations for certain groups is small (9 observations per subgroup), the ability to make statistically significant inferences is impaired. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ignore: Fit model with the same random effects structure from above. While This does not address confounding, we saw from the conditional coefficient of determination the effect of Date on overall model fit was negligible, so I felt confident in that.\n"

    "- However, the marginal coefficient of determination – the proportion of variance in the model explained solely by the fixed effects – is small when comparing the model with the interaction term to the model without it. That means the practical difference in how well the model explains the data for the model with the interaction between `Pinch` and `Day_Chalk` is negligible. \n",

    "- The interaction plot shows some crossover - lines crossing over, indicating potentially that different treatments are better at different ranges of Pinch Strength - between No chalk and FL but these effects do not seem significant after pinch strength exceeds 1.5 lbs. \n",
    "- While a clear separation exists between using chalk and not using chalk, this is not the case among the four chalk types tested. While there is also crossover between the four types of chalk, their confidence intervals (CIs) largely overlap. \n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "From this experiment and subsequent data analysis I would draw three conclusions. These are below: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Chalk Improves Performance:** The use of chalk consistently improved performance. Coefficients for chalk usage were positive in models both with and without interaction terms, indicating a statistically significant benefit. \n",
    "2. **Analyzing The Chalk x Day Combinations is Very difficult:** However, in general this we found that Metolius and FL chalks on earlier days outperformed using no chalk on most days and some chalks or other days. Later days were more variable. \n",
    "3. **Results when Ignoring Confounding:** Modeling chalk type with day as a random effect—while acknowledging potential confounding—produced more understandable results, namely that Ethan's Chalk and Magdust outperformed no chalk, but that we did not detect significant differences between the four chalks.\n",
    "     \n",
    "Overall, this study showed a clear benefit to using chalk, particularly with weaker pinch strengths. This effect size was robust and consistently observed across all models. However, experimental design limitations complicated comparisons between chalk types. The confounding of date and chalk type—due to the specific chalks tested on each day—precluded a separation of their individual effects without making potentially invalid assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simply treat each chalk day combination as its own group, we are left with difficult to understand overlapping results due to the meaninglessness of date for future analysis and the lack of power from smaller groups. Meanwhile, treating date as a random variable relies on the assumption that observed overlaps between control and treatment groups across dates are generalizable to the entire dataset—an assumption that remains unproven. This method gives better power and more understandable results, but is still does not find significant differences in the quality of the four chalk types.  This is partially attributable to the overrepresentation of the control group in the analysis, resulting in fewer observations for each treatment group decreasing power. Furthermore, the lack of double blinding in this study introduces a potential source of bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a first attempt at an experimental design, this project was strong. Future work could focus on retesting these chalk types using a randomized complete block design (RCBD) or a Latin square, which would eliminate confounding, perhaps enabled by better cleaning protocols or by using larger blocks each day (testing two types of chalk instead of one type plus control). It has been super fun to work on this project and I am glad to have done it. \n",
