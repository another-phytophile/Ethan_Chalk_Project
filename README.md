## Objective

Climbing Chalk is commonly used to enhance grip strength in sports like rock climbing or powerlifting. Most commercial brands of climbing chalk are made with Magnesium Carbonate (MgCO3). However, Magnesium carbonate has a wide variety of crystal structures that can affect its ability to absorb water and other fluids. 

To test the effects of using different types of chalk and to see if he could produce a superior chalk, my friend Ethan conducted an experiment on the effects of climbing chalk on grip stregnth. This repository contains the code to analyze the data from his experiment.

## How to Run
To view my report as a website, you can view at nbviewer.org: [notebook in nbviewer]("https://nbviewer.org/github/another-phytophile/Ethan_Chalk_Project/blob/main/Final%20Report.ipynb). 

To run my analysis, you can clone this repository and run the `Final Report.inpyb` file in Jupyter Notebook. The analysis uses R and Python.

## Conclusions

1. **Chalk Improves Performance:** The use of chalk consistently improved performance. 
2. **Type of Chalk was Not Significant:** We did not consistently observe significant differences in grip strength between the different types of chalk, which was at least in part due to experimental design issues (confounding) that could not be corrected in data analysis.
