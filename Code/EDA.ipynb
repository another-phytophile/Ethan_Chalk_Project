    "The original data was not formatted in the way of a long table, so I used excel to clean the data. Multiple explanatory variables were encoded in color or order of the tables, so they needed to be made explicit. I used a series of formulas for that. Thus, I created long formats of the `Chalk_Results.xlsx` and `Randomized tests.xlsx` (`Chalk_Long.xlsm` and `Metadata.slsx`) and merged and created labels for them in python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are:\n",
    "- Code: a number from 1-24. In excel, this column's color is indicative of date, and its value is also indicative of control (or chalk) and treatment. Code + bChalk form the key for merging metadata with chalk_long. \n",
    "- bChalk: a number from 1-4 (1=FL. 2=Metolius, 3=Magdust, 4=Ethan's Chalk), not directly indicative of whether chalk was used. Code + bChalk form the key for merging metadata with chalk_long.\n",
    "- Pinch_Order: Order in which test was conducted, for each attempt (code number), the test was performed three times sequentially. Pinch_Order + bChalk + Code forms the primary key. \n",
    "- Pinch: The weight at which the board was pinched. \n",
    "- Pull: The weight just before the hand slipped. **Our dependent variable**. \n",
    "- Chalk: The actual chalk used, 0 is added for control. \n",
    "- Person: The person conducting the test, one intermediate and one advanced climber. \n",
    "- Day: The day when the test was conducted. Dates were, 10/30/2024,10/31/2024,11/4/2024,11/6/2024,11/8/2024,11/10/2024, and 11/14/2024. Last two were apparently \"noticeably slippery\". \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scratch\n",
    "- Chalks 1-4: type of chalk. \n",
    "- Randomization: order (chalk/nochalk) tested\n",
    "- Colors: Day indicators\n",
    "- Dark red: see excel\n",
    "- Run number: 1-24 Ethan, 25-48 Jackson\n",
    "- Shading: 1-6 no chalk, 7-12 no chalk, number corresponds to weight in accordance w the metadata spreadsheet\n",
    "- Pinches 1-3/Pulls 1-3\n",
    "- Pulls 1-3: values before slip\n",
